# Seeker Mod by The Cyber Guy
Concept behind Seeker is simple, just like we host phishing pages to get credentials why not host a fake page that requests your location like many popular location based websites. The Mods are made by <a href="https://instagram.com/the_cyber_guy_?igshid=9t6r1rf3fnr1"> Ther Cyber Guy </a>.Seeker Hosts a fake website on **In Built PHP Server** and uses **Ngrok** to generate a link which we will forward to the target, website asks for Location Permission and if the target allows it, we can get :

* Longitude

* Latitude

* Accuracy

* Altitude - Not always available

* Direction - Only available if user is moving

* Speed - Only available if user is moving

Along with Location Information we also get **Device Information** without any permissions :

* Operating System

* Platform

* Number of CPU Cores

* Amount of RAM - Approximate Results

* Screen Resolution

* GPU information

* Browser Name and Version

* Public IP Address

* IP Address Reconnaissance


**This tool is a Proof of Concept and is for Educational Purposes Only, Seeker shows what data a malicious website can gather about you and your devices and why you should not click on random links and allow critical permissions such as Location etc.**
